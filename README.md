# spotify-data-analysis
Data analysis using data from Spotify to predict whether someone will like a song or not. 

This repository contains three files - a PDF of the data analysis paper, a RMD file of the same name that contains the code used to create the PDF, and a RMD file titled Music that was used as "scratch work" for the final RMD and PDF. There is a csv file to download along with the RMD files to run the code. 

This paper was written to showcase my coding skills in R, as well as my math, writing, and problem solving skills.
